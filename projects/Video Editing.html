 <h2>Video Editing</h2>
 <p>This video was put together and edited using After Affects as an assignment with the purpose of creating the opening title sequence for a tv-show that doesn't have one. I picked the show 'Heartstopper' and paired it to the song 'I Want To Be With You' by Chloe Moriondo.</p>
